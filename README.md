# Qwak Model `DEPLOY` Action (v1)

This GitHub Action triggers a Qwak Cloud Deployment for a machine learning model Build. It provides a seamless integration with Qwak's platform, allowing you to deploy and monitor your models directly from your GitHub repository.

## Action Flow

1. **Initialize Deployment**: Trigger build using the `qwak models deploy` CLI command.
2. **Extract IDs**: Retrieve the Deployment ID and Build ID from the command output.
3. **Monitor Status**: Continuously check the Deployment status from the Qwak Cloud every 10 seconds while it's in the `PENDING` or `INITIALIZING` state.
4. **Output Results**: Once the deployment is complete, the Action outputs the Deployment ID and STATUS.

<br>

## Inputs

- `qwak-api-key`: A [Qwak API key](https://app.qwak.ai/qwak-admin#personal-api-keys). Recommended to be set up as a repository secret.
- `sdk-version`: Specifies the Qwak-SDK version required to trigger this deploy. Default is `latest`.
- `deploy-type`: **(Required)** Type of deployment. Supported types are `realtime`, `stream`, and `batch`.
- `model-id`: **(Required)** The ID of the model to be deployed.
- `build-id`: The Build ID to be deployed. If not specified, the latest successful build will be deployed.
- `tags`: One or more TAGS separated by comma. If `build-id` is specified, `tags` will be ignored, otherwise the action will look for the latest successful build with the tags mentioned.
- `param-list`: A list of key-value pairs representing deployment parameters. These are specified in the format `NAME=VALUE` and separated by commas. For a complete list of available parameters for each deployment type, refer to [Deployment Types](#deployment-types).
- `env-vars`: Environment variables for the deployment, specified in the format `NAME=VALUE` and separated by commas. These can be used to set or override environment settings within the deployment process.
- `instance`: Specifies the hardware type to deploy the model on. The instance defines the allocated CPU/GPU and Memory resources. [Instances list.](https://docs-saas.qwak.com/docs/instance-sizes) Default is `small`.
- `replicas`: The number of selected instances to provision for this deployment. Default is `1`.
- `iam-role-arn`: Custom IAM Role ARN that Qwak should assume in order to access external resources during the build process.
- `environment`: Specifies the Qwak environment to use, such as `dev`, `staging`, or `production`. If not specified, the default environment will be used.
- `timeout-after`: Specifies how many minutes to wait for the build to complete before timing out. Default is `30`.

<br>

## Outputs

- `deploy-id`: The ID of the deployment.
- `deploy-status`: The status of the deployment once it has finished execution or times out.


Output Example 
```bash
deploy-id=bc3ceeca-e4ed-48b9-8ff1-80427923f1cf
deploy-status=SUCCESSFUL_DEPLOYMENT

## Deployment Types


### Realtime
Qwak real time models deploy your ML models with a lightweight, simple and scalable REST API wrapper. We set up the network requirements and deploy your model on a managed Kubernetes cluster, allowing you to leverage auto-scaling and security

```bash
timeout=3000,server-workers=4,variation-name=default,daemon-mode=false
```

### Stream

Streaming deployments let you easily connect Kafka streams with your models to perform real-time inference.

Using streaming deployments can be useful for processing large amounts of distributed data to avoiding complex triggering and scheduling architectures as fresh data arrives. A streaming deployment will consume messages from a Kafka topic and produce predictions into a Kafka topic of your choice.

  deploy:
    if: needs.build.outputs.build_status == 'SUCCESSFUL' 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
